### Hi there, I am Raphael 👋

## Thanks for stopping by. Here's a little bit about myself...

- 🤔 My pronouns are: He/His/Him
- 🌱 I’m a french student coming from the city of Saint-Etienne, France and I'm currently learning **AI & Data Science** at French Engineering School **IMT Mines Alès**
- 📈 My expected graduation date was August 2024, but I recently chose to do a gap year in order to gain technical skills and field experiences, postponing my graduate date to August 2025. Another goal of this gap year is to help me find in which field of AI and data I really want to work in the future. That's why I intend to realize **two internships** during my gap year, with **at least one abroad** to discover & deal with interculturality and foreign language at work 
- 🌄 During my leisure time, I practice a lot of sports. In my daily life, I do a lot of tennis (with the school team) and running, but when I have more time, what I really love is doing **outdoor/moutain sports** such as trail, ski and hiking
- 📖 I also like reading. I mainly read **exploration stories**, such as the ones of Mike Horn, but also fictions or personal develoment books
- 🎵 When doing all of these activities, I listen to music almost all the time: pop, jazz, EDM and a lot of hip-hop/rap
- 🎯 On my github page, you will find mainly **school projects** but sometimes some personal projects. In any case, all these projects, school and personal, had for goal to initiate me to new programming languages or new concepts, which can explain some imperfections in these
